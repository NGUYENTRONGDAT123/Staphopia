Different from the algorithms/models introduced in the first half of the semester, the dataset used for association rules mining is **transactional**. This dataset do not have the label information that is mandatory in predictive data mining. "

    "These requirements suggest association mining, a market basket analysis. The\n",
    "data for this problem is usually consists of two variables: a transaction ID and an item. For each transaction, there is a list of items. For the banking\n",
